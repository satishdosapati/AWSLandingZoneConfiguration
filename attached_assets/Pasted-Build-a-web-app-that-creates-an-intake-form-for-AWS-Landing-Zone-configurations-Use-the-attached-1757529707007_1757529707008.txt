Build a web app that creates an intake form for AWS Landing Zone configurations.  
Use the attached PDF ("AWS Landing Zone Comparison Table Including Very Small Customers") as the source for the configuration options and their details.

Requirements:

1. Intake Form
   - Present the different landing zone options from the PDF (Very Small, Small, Medium, Large).
   - Each option should be selectable (radio buttons or dropdown).
   - Show a short description of the key components/features from the PDF when an option is selected.

2. Cost Model
   - For each configuration, assign default assumptions for:
     * Infra cost per month
     * Professional services cost (one-time)
     * Managed services cost (per VM + per TB of storage)
     * Default number of VMs and storage, based on customer size
   - Formula:
     Managed Services Monthly = (default VMs × cost/VM) + (default TB × cost/TB)
     Total Monthly Estimate = Infra cost + Managed Services Monthly
   - Show all costs in a results section after selection.

3. Results Display
   - When a partner selects a configuration, display:
     * Monthly Infrastructure Cost
     * One-time Professional Services Cost
     * Monthly Managed Services Cost
     * Total Estimated Monthly Cost
   - Display results in a clean card layout.

4. UI/UX
   - Clean, simple web form with Tailwind or similar styling.
   - Use cards or panels for the results.
   - Optionally allow partner to adjust VM count and storage to see updated costs.
   - Include a button to export results to PDF/CSV.

5. Tech Stack
   - Use React with Tailwind CSS (or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript if easier).
   - Make the configuration table data (from the PDF) hardcoded in JSON inside the app for now.

Goal:
A working prototype where a partner can select a landing zone configuration, and the app instantly calculates and displays infra costs, professional services costs, and managed services costs based on the defaults derived from the PDF.
